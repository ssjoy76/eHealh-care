                                <br> Despite these momentous achievements, there is still much work to be done, particularly for women in rural areas. Births in rural areas still most commonly take place at home without a skilled attendant, and there are little, if any, ambulatory or emergency services available in the event of complications. In addition, women living with fistula in rural areas of Bangladesh are too often hidden from society or hesitant to come forward due to the social stigma attached to their condition, and often do not know that treatment options are available.
